# TMUX Configuration
This repository contains my current tmux configuration.  It does not have anything special yet, but is just a start.  

## Setting Up
To set this up I generally use the following commands:  
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/KevinMidkiff/tmux-configuration.git ~/.tmux-configuration
    $ cd ~
    $ ln -s ~/.tmux-configuration/tmux.conf .tmux.conf
```
